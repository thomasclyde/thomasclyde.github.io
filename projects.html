					<h3>CaseAide</h3>
					Although I can't say much about CaseAide (NDA), I have been working on the client-side of this Android application for the past 6 months. I am working with a team of 10 developers, designers and managers in order 
					to provide our client with an application for use in counties throughout California. This application has great potential and should see a lot of use in the near future.

					<h3>Military</h3>
					Another mobile and web application that I cannot say much about, but this application will be designed to assits active military members and their families in adapting to the 
					life of the military. This application is developing slowly, as I am the only developer involved, but I do plan to complete the first iteration by mid 2016. The first branch of 
					focus will the the United States Marine Corps.
