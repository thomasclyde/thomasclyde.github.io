					          Welcome! This website is dedicated to my journey into technology and the professions known as Computer Science.
					Feel free to explore each page and learn about who I am. This website is not a typical biography or resume style advertisement
					for potential employers. I am interested in being completely geniuin in regard to who I am and what my capabilities are. I
					 come from a simple family that has made a living as truck drivers. I am the first of my family to receive a Bachelors 
					 degree. Family is the most important part of life and I have no interest in putting my love for technology and Computer 
					 Science ahead of them. I plan to work hard in my field, but when it is time to go home, my focus will always turn completely 
					 to my family. Anyway, explore the website and discover what I do and what brought me here! - Thomas
